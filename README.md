To install Conda (specifically the Anaconda distribution) on Ubuntu Linux, follow these key steps:

1. **Download the latest Anaconda installer** for Linux from the official Anaconda repository. For example, you can download the installer with wget in your terminal:

   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2024.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Verify the installer checksum** (optional but recommended) to ensure the file integrity:

   ```bash
   sha256sum Anaconda3-2024.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

   Compare the output with the official checksum provided on the Anaconda site.

3. **Run the Anaconda installer script**:

   ```bash
   bash Anaconda3-2024.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

   - Review and accept the license terms by typing `yes`.
   - Choose the installation location or accept the default (~your_home/anaconda3).
   - Opt to initialize Anaconda by default when prompted (recommended).

4. **Activate the installation** by sourcing the `.bashrc` file so changes take effect:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   After this, you should see `(base)` in your terminal prompt indicating Conda base environment is active.

5. **Verify the installation** by running:

   ```bash
   conda info
   ```

   This will display information about your Conda installation if successful[11][13][15][9].

### Additional Notes:
- Anaconda installs a large collection of packages. If you prefer a minimal installation, you can install Miniconda instead.
- Conda can also be initialized for other shells like fish using `conda init fish`.
- To uninstall, simply remove the Anaconda installation directory and optionally cleanup Conda-related config files[9].

This approach works reliably on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 LTS versions and newer Linux releases[11][15].
